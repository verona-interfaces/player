  version: '6.1.0'
  description: |
    This is one part of the [Verona Online Assessment Standards](https://verona-interfaces.github.io). All messages are sent via the postMessage function of the html page. The player takes the page root of its parent as target (parent.window), and the application binds the function call to the iframe element of the player.

    Most important, the message body carries as first parameter the operationId of the message.

    The html page MUST contain a script-tag with metadata. The syntax and structure of this data are described [here](https://verona-interfaces.github.io/intro/metadata.html).

      type: object
      description: These data stand for the answers and some additional information on the status of responding. Emitted by the player during the test, it is given back to the player on start to restore the former state.
      properties:
        dataParts:
          description: This data is used by the player to restore the former response state and by data processing
            systems to analyse the responses. The host must buffer all data parts, because the player might send only
            changed data parts, not always the whole package. The host stores all parts but only the last given
            version (respect timeStamp!). Every data part is identified by a unique key, the data is stored as
            serialized object (string).
          type: object
          additionalProperties:
            type: string

            page2: '{"c": "sehr gut!", "d": true}'
        presentationProgress:
          description: This reports the progress of presentation of unit content. The host can enable or disable the
            navigation to the next unit depending on that value. For example, all audio elements are required to be
            played or all pages must be presented to the page bottom. This way, giving no response to an item is
            always intended.
          type: string
          enum:
            - none
            - some
            - complete
          example: 'none'
        responseProgress:
          description: This reports the progress of responding. The host can enable or disable the navigation to the
            next unit depending on that value. The value 'complete' announces not only that all required responses are
            given but that these responses are valid too. The value 'complete' can be sent even not all responses are
            given - the host is interested only in REQUIRED responses. So make sure to mark all response elements
            correctly corresponding to this behaviour.
          type: string
          enum:
            - none
            - some
            - complete
          example: 'some'
        unitStateDataType:
          type: string
          description: This string specifies the format of the data stored in dataParts (value). Every
            transformation or analysis of stored unit data requires knowledge about the format. When the host sends
            data to the player to restore the former unit state, the player should check the given data type to
            avoid data mess after getting an old data type.
          example: 'iqb-standard@2.1.2'

    NavigationTarget:
      description: This enumeration lists all possible targets the player could send a navigation request for, relative
        to the position of the current unit. This could be the next and previous unit, last and first unit of the current
        range of units (booklet, testlet) or the end of the test. The ending is seen as kind of termination of test,
        e. g. the announcement of the testee, that all responses are given. What exactly the host will navigate to
        depends of the nature of the test or the use case and might depend on configuration parameters of the specific
        booklet as well.
      type: string
      enum:
        - next
        - previous
        - first
        - last
        - end
      example: 'next'

    SessionIdString:
      description: The session id flags all communication. If a message has no or empty
        session id, it's not processed. The session id is unique and was generated by the application. Any
        simple algorithm would work. The session id helps to link the correct unit with the
        data of the message. Using the id of the player hosting html element is less reliable, because the
        element could be reused with another unit.
      type: string
      example: 'idk8ur5jf9ru5jk'

    PlayerConfig:
      type: object
      description: This data supplies some information or instruction about this specific run of the unit
        (number, unit title, some behavioral data for the player).
      properties:
        unitNumber:
          description: The player might show the numbering of the current unit to ease the navigation.
          type: integer
          minimum: 1
          example: '14'
        unitTitle:
          description: The player might show the title of the current unit. Unless the unit definition could consist of
            a title, the host might decide to change the title. For example, this is necessary if one unit appears more
            then once in a booklet.
          type: string
          maxLength: 50
          example: 'Ein wunderbarer Ausflug'
        unitId:
          description: The player might include the internal unit id in state variables or logs.
          type: string
          maxLength: 20
          example: 'M24093EX'
        logPolicy:
          description: The host expects the player to send no logs, only important logs, all possible logs or even logs
            for debugging purposes. This is a guideline. The player can decide what exactly the logging consists of.
          type: string
          enum:
            - disabled
            - lean
            - rich
            - debug
          example: 'lean'
        pagingMode:
          description: If the player makes it optional, then the page presentation can be changed by the host. The pages are
            presented separately, with page navigation buttons, concatenated to one big page or concatenated in snap mode (scrolling vertically, but
            only one page is visible at a time).
          type: string
          enum:
            - separate
            - buttons
            - concat-scroll
            - concat-scroll-snap
          example: 'concat-scroll'
        printMode:
          description: If this mode is 'on', the host presents the unit as preview for printing. Depending on the unit,
            the player modifies the presentation by (1) assignment of print styles, (2) ALL unit parts are displayed regardless
            of conditions, (3) all pages are displayed among each other, (4) the height of the given space is ignored
            (no vertical scrollbars by player). If the mode is set to 'on-with-ids', the player adds control labels to
            show the IDs.
          type: string
          enum:
            - off
            - on
            - on-with-ids
          example: 'off'
        enabledNavigationTargets:
          description: This lets the player know, what navigation target is enabled to natigate to. The player might
            then alter the presentation of responding buttons.
          type: array
          items:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/NavigationTarget"
        startPage:
          description: This requests the player to navigate to a certain page after loading. The host might know this
            page id from former usages of the unit.
          type: string
          example: 'page5'
        directDownloadUrl:
          description: After starting the player and loading the unit definition and former responses, it might be
            necessary to load additional code or data from the server. This data is identified by an resource ID
            (usually a file name). The player can download this resource by itself without further interaction with
            the host frontend. The property directDownloadUrl provides the url for download. The player extends this
            url by an url separator "/" and the resource ID (uri-encoded if needed).

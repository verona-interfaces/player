  description: This is one part of the Verona Online Assessment Standards.
    All messages are sent via the postMessage function of the html page. The player takes the page root of its parent
    as target (parent.window), and the application binds the function call to the iframe element of the player.

    Most important, the message body carries as first parameter the operationId of the message.
